Welcome to the repository of Smart Insurance! This project is designed to provide a comprehensive set of React components for building user interfaces in web applications. It uses TypeScript for enhanced code reliability, Tailwind CSS for styling, and includes various other tools to ensure accessibility and ease of form management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14.x or higher
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Yarn or pnpm (Optional, alternative package managers)

### Installation

#### Using npm
```xml
```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
git clone https://github.com/salmanclever/insurance-system.git
cd insurance-system
npm install
```


```

#### Using Yarn

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see the components in action:

#### Using npm
```xml
```type:Generated,lang:Bash,path:,lines:0-0
npm run dev
```


```

#### Using Yarn
```xml
